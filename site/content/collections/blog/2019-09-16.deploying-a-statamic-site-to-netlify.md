    text: '<p>Looking for solutions for this problem I came across <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank">Netlify</a>, a PaaS that allows you to host static sites for free. Since this site has always been fairly static without any forms or dynamic content, this would be a perfect solution.</p><h2>Why Statamic?</h2><p>I''m pretty much in love with&nbsp;<a href="https://statamic.com/" target="_blank">Statamic</a>. It has one of the best developer experiences I''ve had with a CMS, making it very easy to define sections, fieldsets, templates... without ever having to leave your code editor. This combined with the beautiful and amazing writing experience, it''s just a no-brainer for me to keep using it.</p>'

    text: '<p>But.. Statamic is a dynamic PHP application, which can''t be hosted straight on Netlify ðŸ¤”</p><h3>Full measure static caching to the rescue</h3><p>Statamic has a great <a href="https://docs.statamic.com/caching#static-page" target="_blank">full measure static caching</a> system, which allows you to define a folder where the static files are stored. This works when the pages are visited from the browser.&nbsp;</p><p>My first thought was to use our <a href="https://github.com/spatie/crawler" target="_blank">Spatie Crawler</a>&nbsp;package to crawl the pages so they would be stored in the static html files, and then deploying that to Netlify, but this was slow and needed a web server to be used, so it couldn''t be run directly in Netlify''s build system.</p><h2>Statamic Kernel</h2><p>Statamic has an HTTP Kernel which handles all its requests, as you can see in the code of the <i>index.php</i> file, this is also how Laravel handles its requests.<br></p>'

    text: '<p>We need to call the <i>-&gt;terminate($request, $response) </i>function on the Kernel, as Statamic handles its static caching in this method. Another way we could solve this is to save the response into html files ourselves, but I''ve chosen to let Statamic handle this.</p><h2>Not quite there</h2><p>Once all requests are handled, you''ll notice Statamic saves the homepage as <i>_.html</i> and your pages as <i>page_.html</i>, Netlify however wants an <i>index.html</i>, and no underscores in the other filenames, so we''ll have to run a quick rename on all the files.</p>'
